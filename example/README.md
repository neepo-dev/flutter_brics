# Brics Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `Brics` and `Bric` widgets to create responsive layouts in Flutter.
This example includes three different use cases:

### 1. Simple Example
A basic implementation with minimal configuration. It shows how `Bric` widgets adjust their size based on breakpoints.

### 2. Complex Example
Demonstrates advanced usage of `Brics` with parameters like `gap`, `crossGap`, and `maxWidth`. The layout dynamically adjusts based on screen width.

### 3. Inside a Dialog
An example of using `Brics` inside an `AlertDialog`, ensuring proper alignment and width constraints.
